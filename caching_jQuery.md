### why?
*  most sites use jQuery, and have it hosted on Google
*  but in places like China, where Google's server aren't quite accessible
*  and those webpages just can't live without jQuery
  
* So a cached jQuery etc. can save these websites, and also help boost browsing speed

### solution
* maybe a chrome extension to cache Google Hosted open libraries
  * no harm
  * can save total requests
  
* (don't know if it's practical)
* and disabling JS is an option also xD
* no it's not, I can't submit this commit
* you can write an article < a day without JS >
