why?
  most sites use jQuery, and have it hosted on Google
  but in places like China, where Google's server aren't quite accessible
  and those webpages just can't live without jQuery
  
So a cached jQuery etc. can save these websites, and also help boost browsing speed

maybe a chrome extension to cache Google Hosted open libraries
  no harm
  can save total requests
  
(don't know if it's practical)
