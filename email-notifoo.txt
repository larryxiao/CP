design
- embed a small http request in mail, and log email title or some identifier
- use a web server to receive this info, and display it

pro
- can know the mail is read, and maybe know more about reader (location, ip ...)

con
- might be annoying (worse than prompting for read receipt) 

obstacle
- email client might not offer way to send this request
- (maybe embed in picture, get request)
